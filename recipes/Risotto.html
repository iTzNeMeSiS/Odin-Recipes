    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g wholegrain pearl barley</li>
        <li>2 tsp reduced-salt vegetable bouillon powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1 large leek , chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>⅔ pack basil</li>
        <li>generous squeeze of lemon juice</li>
        <li>125g Tenderstem broccoli from a 200g pack</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour a litre of cold water over the barley, cover and leave to soak overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, drain the barley, reserve the liquid and use it to make 500ml vegetable bouillon. Heat half the oil in a non-stick pan, add the leek and cook briefly to soften. Tip half into a bowl, then add the barley and bouillon to the pan, cover and simmer for 20 mins.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add the garlic, basil, remaining oil, the lemon juice and 3 tbsp water to the leeks in the bowl, and blitz to a paste with a stick blender</li>
        <li>When the barley has cooked for 20 mins, add the broccoli to the pan and cook for 5-10 mins more until both are tender. Stir in the basil purée, heat very briefly (to retain the fragrance), then spoon into bowls to serve.</li>
    </ol>
