# odin-recipes


This project is to build on practicing my basic HTML knowledge that I have learned while doing the Odin project. I will be building a basic recipe website that will have a main index page which will have a few links to a few recipes.

After completing this project, I have accomplished:

    Properly seting up html files accordingly
    Linked html files together
    Inputed images with alternative text
    Created ordered and unordered lists for the steps and recipes
    used body and paragraph elements to describe what the recipe is all about
    Linked a CSS stylesheet to the HTML files
    Properly implemented various types of CSS selectors and inheritance.

Skills learned in this project:
